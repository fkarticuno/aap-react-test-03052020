1. Download the zip file(react‑test.zip).
2. Install the dependencies ‑  npm install
3. This is a very basic react redux task(please use redux, even though it's not
necessary for this simpler application)
4. There is a JSON file called "products.json"(has array of products) in the
project directory. You need to display the list of products(from JSON) like the
below image.

5. You need not install any additional dependencies(only install new dependencies,
if you are aiming for a bonus point) ‑ project is scaffolded from CRA,you can
add new files and directories are needed.
6. You need to create redux store and store the products json in the store, and
access the data from the store.
7. Make sure the ProductItem component(see the below img) is reusable(it should
accept product object as the prop)
8. On "Add to Cart" button click, log the part number and price to the console as
an object.
